I wanna express my gratitude and thanks to my friend, Elijah,
who gave me the courage to push my first project in Github.

NOTE:
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Solution Retargeting Required ⚠️
Welcome to the repository! Before you can successfully build and run this solution, you must retarget the projects within your code editor.

This step is critical to ensure compatibility with your local environment and installed SDKs/frameworks. Failure to retarget will result in build errors.

🛠️ Getting Started: Retargeting Instructions
Follow these steps immediately after cloning or downloading the repository to ensure a smooth setup:

Open the Solution: Launch your recommended code editor (see below) and open the solution file (.sln).

Access Retargeting (Visual Studio):

In Solution Explorer, right-click the Solution node (the top item, usually named after the project).

Select Retarget Solution or Retarget Projects (the exact wording may vary slightly depending on your IDE version).

Confirm Target Versions:

A dialog will appear listing the projects and their current/target frameworks/platforms.

Select the desired target versions (e.g., a specific .NET Framework or Windows SDK version) that you have installed on your machine.

Click OK or Apply to confirm and apply the changes.

Rebuild: Once retargeting is complete, rebuild the entire solution to ensure all projects compile against the newly configured targets.

💻 Recommended Development Environment
For the best experience, including performance, stability, and full feature support, we highly recommend using a modern version of the Visual Studio IDE:

Recommended Editor: Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio 2026 (or newer).

These versions provide the necessary tools and compatibility for the project's structure and target platforms.

While other editors may work, the retargeting process is most straightforward and fully supported within the recommended Visual Studio IDE.
